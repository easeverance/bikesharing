# Citi Bike Sharing

## Project Overview
Last year a trip to NYC sparked the idea to open a bike rental facility in Des Moines Iowa.  The concept is based off of the Citi Bike Bike Share in NYC.  However, what works in NYC may not work in Des Moines.  The goal is to take Citi Bike Sharing Rental data from August 2019 and to analyze it in order to see statistics and to see what will and what won't work in Des Moines. 

## Results

This graph compares the checkout times for users.  Showing that the majority of bike usage is under 20 minutes.

This graph dives deeper into the first graph by looking at the gender breakdwon of who is checking out the bikes.  Here you can see that the tripduration is similar between men and women, men make up the majority of bike rentals.

This graph shows that the prime time to rental bikes is Monday through Friday.  Prime hours being between 6AM and 9AM and again from 5PM to 7PM.  On the weekends there is also an uptick in bike rentals especially on Saturday with a peak between 10AM and 12PM.

Again this graphy dives deeper into the previous graphy of weekday rentals by seperating out rentals based off of Gender.  It is evident that during the peek hours the bike rentals are being rented by men.

Here we can see the breakdown of customer (individual rentals) versus subscriber (yearly subscription to bike sharing program) broken down by gender.  Most of the bike rentals are done by men who have a bike share subscription.

This pie chart further confrims that out of the total rides of 2,344,224 that occured in August of 2019 the majority is by men at 1,530,272.

These bar charts further confirm that the prime hours of rental/usage is from 6AM to 9AM with a peak at 8 AM and then again from 5PM to 9PM with a peak at 5PM.

## Summary
In summary there seems to be a correlation between bike rental/usage and commute to work times.  Men make up the majority of the riders with the highest usuage during the work week from Monday through Friday.  For this to work in Des Moines I would suggest additional investigation.  Such as the population that has cars but would be interested in using a bike rental facility to commute from home to work.  In addition I think that Des Moines would be better fit to attract tourists instead of commuters to their bike share program.  Here, futher investigation into rentals that had longer trip  durations would be prudent.  One could look at where the bikes started and ended.  How long tourists are interested in using a bike share program.  Lastly, the bikes that are used for longer periods of time how often are they repaired.  Would be good questions and good visualizations to create here.
